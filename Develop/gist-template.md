# Regex Tutorial: Understanding Email Validation

In this tutorial, we'll explore the regex pattern used for validating email addresses.

## Summary

The regex pattern we'll be focusing on is:

```regex
/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/

This regex pattern is designed to validate email addresses based on common email format standards.

## Regex Components

### Anchors

Anchors such as ^ and $ are used in this regex to match the start and end of the string, ensuring that the entire email address is validated.

### Quantifiers

Quantifiers like + are used to specify that certain components of the email address (such as the local part and domain name) can have one or more characters.

### OR Operator

The OR operator | is not explicitly used in this regex, but it's implied in character classes like [a-z0-9_\.-] and [\da-z\.-], allowing multiple characters to match.

### Character Classes

Character classes like [a-z0-9_\.-] and [\da-z\.-] are used to define valid characters for the local part and domain name of the email address.

### Flags

No specific flags are used in this regex.

### Grouping and Capturing

Groups ( ) are used in this regex to capture the local part, domain name, and top-level domain (TLD) separately for validation.

### Bracket Expressions

Bracket expressions like [a-z\.] are used to specify valid characters for the TLD, allowing between 2 to 6 lowercase letters or dots.

### Greedy and Lazy Match

The regex uses greedy matching by default, ensuring that the entire email address matches the pattern specified.

### Boundaries

The ^ and $ anchors act as boundaries, ensuring that the regex matches the entire email address and not just a part of it.

### Back-references
No back-references are used in this regex.

### Look-ahead and Look-behind
No look-ahead or look-behind assertions are used in this regex.
