# Computer Science for JavaScript: Regex Tutorial

## Description.

Welcome to this Regex Tutorial, where we delve into the intricacies of validating email addresses using a specific regular expression (regex). By exploring the regex /^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/, we aim to provide a detailed understanding of its components and how they contribute to email address validation.

# Overview

This tutorial dissects the regex, offering insights into its functionality and purpose in validating email addresses.

## The Challenge

Take on the challenge of crafting a comprehensive tutorial on email validation using regex. Our approach includes thorough research, regex pattern creation, GitHub Gist setup, and detailed explanations tailored for beginners and academics alike.



## Assigned User Story:
```
AS A web development student
I WANT a tutorial explaining a specific regex
SO THAT I can understand the search pattern the regex defines
```

## Acceptance Criteria:
```
GIVEN a regex tutorial
WHEN I open the tutorial
THEN I see a descriptive title and introductory paragraph explaining the purpose of the tutorial, a summary describing the regex featured in the tutorial, a table of contents linking to different sections that break down each component of the regex and explain what it does, and a section about the author with a link to the author’s GitHub profile
WHEN I click on the links in the table of contents
THEN I am taken to the corresponding sections of the tutorial
WHEN I read through each section of the tutorial
THEN I find a detailed explanation of what a specific component of the regex does
WHEN I reach the end of the tutorial
THEN I find a section about the author and a link to the author’s GitHub profile
```

## Installation Process:
**Set up a GitHub Gist:**

1. Sign in to your GitHub account or create one if you haven't already.
2. Visit: https://gist.github.com/ to create a new Gist.
3. In the "Gist description" field, enter a brief description of the challenge, such as "Email Regex Challenge".
4. Add a new file to the Gist by clicking on "Add file" and give it a suitable name, like "email_regex_challenge.md".
5. In your newly created Gist, write a brief explanation of the regex, describing each component and its purpose in the email validation process.
6. Explain how the regex can be modified to accept new requirements, such as uppercase letters or additional special characters in the email address.

**Share your Gist:**

7. Once you have completed the explanation and modifications to the regex, save your Gist by clicking on "Create public Gist" or "Create secret Gist" as per your preference.
8. Share the link to your Gist with others to discuss different approaches and understanding of the regex.

By completing this challenge, you will not only have a better understanding of the email validation regex but also gain experience in setting up and sharing a GitHub Gist.
